## Question 3

(K&R Exercise 5-4) Write the function <code>strend(s,t)</code> which returns 1 if the string t occurs at the end of the string s, and zero otherwise. **Be sure to use pointers.** Verify that your function works with at least 3 examples.

Compile Steps:
gcc q3.c
Output:
The ends are not the same:over, the class is over.
The text 'over.' is the same as the end of string 'the class is over.'
The text 's' is the same as the end of string 'ECE160 is a difficult class'
